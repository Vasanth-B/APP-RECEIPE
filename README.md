# Recipes App

## Overview

The **Recipes App** is a full-featured CRUD application for managing recipes, built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. Designed with a clean MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, the app offers a RESTful API for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting recipe entries. API functionality and documentation are streamlined with Postman for easy testing and demonstration.

---

## Core Features

- **Recipe Creation:** Add new recipes with complete information, including title, ingredients, and preparation steps.
- **Retrieve Recipes:** Access all recipes or filter by specific recipe ID for detailed information.
- **Update Recipes:** Modify existing recipe entries, allowing users to keep content current.
- **Delete Recipes:** Remove recipes from the database with a single API call.
- **Structured CRUD API:** Each function adheres to RESTful principles for clear and predictable API interactions.
- **MVC Architecture:** Ensures a clean separation of code concerns, improving readability and maintainability.
- **Robust Validation & Error Handling:** Handles common issues like missing data, invalid inputs, or non-existent records.

## Technology Stack

- **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime environment for efficient server-side development.
- **Express.js:** Lightweight, fast web framework that simplifies API building.
- **MongoDB:** Flexible, NoSQL database solution ideal for dynamic data storage.
- **Mongoose:** Object Data Modeling (ODM) library that bridges MongoDB and JavaScript, making data manipulation intuitive.
- **Postman:** Facilitates API testing, request simulation, and documentation.

3. **Retrieve Recipe by ID:** `GET /recipes/:id`  
   - Retrieves a single recipe based on its unique ID.
   
4. **Update a Recipe:** `PUT /recipes/:id`  
   - Updates details of an existing recipe by ID.
   
5. **Delete a Recipe:** `DELETE /recipes/:id`  
   - Deletes a specified recipe from the database.
